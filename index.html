  <h2>My name is Mason and I enjoy coding.</h2>
  <h3>Languages I know:<br>• C# (3 years)<br>• Java (1 year)<br>• C++ (1 year)<br>• Python (1 year)</h3>
  <p><br>I started coding C# in Unity (around 3 years ago) and I made quite a few projects before moving on to some other languages. I started java by making Spigot plugins for a Minecraft server my friend was making. I learned some valuable skills in the process and have started making plugins to post on Spigot. I have also recently started working on a Unity game that I will showcase on here at some point.</p>
